# Contributing

`SegmentPageKit` welcomes both fixes, improvements, and feature additions. If you'd like to contribute, open an issue or a Pull Request with a detailed description of your proposal and/or changes. 

### One issue or bug per Pull Request

Keep your Pull Requests small. Small PRs are easier to reason about which makes them significantly more likely to get merged.

### Issues before features

If you want to add a feature, consider filing an [Issue](https://github.com/vparjunmohan/SegmentPageKit/issues). An Issue can provide the opportunity to discuss the requirements and implications of a feature with you before you start writing code. This is not a hard requirement, however. Submitting a Pull Request to demonstrate an idea in code is also acceptable, it just carries more risk of change.

### Backwards compatibility

Respect the minimum deployment target. If you are adding code that uses new APIs, make sure to prevent older clients from crashing or misbehaving.

### Forwards compatibility

Please do not write new code using deprecated APIs.

### Pull Request Process

1. Use the provided [Pull Request template](https://github.com/vparjunmohan/SegmentPageKit/blob/bc9c3b2496e574c8038d6ee13c322d2d2b4326a2/.github/pull_request_template.md). 
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the public interface, if necessary.
